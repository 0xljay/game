# game

This repository is a type of game. It's not really a game, but I don't know what else to call it. 

I guess the point is to examine one's belief system through questions. Then store the data somehow and compare. This should yield more questions..

Perhaps, one day, we will get to the most interesting question.

WARNING: is a question mark the only way to know if a piece of text preceding the '?' is actually a question?
